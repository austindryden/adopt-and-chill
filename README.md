## Project Description  
Adopt and Chill solves the serious problem of overcrowded animal shelters in a silly way. The user enters a zip code, clicks on an image representing their preferred marijuana species (Indica, Sativa, or Hybrid), and receives two recommendations - a marijuana strain and an available shelter dog with similar characteristics.

<!-- *first function -> build dom elements for zipcode form and reset button. 
* if whatever entered is not 5 digits, ignores and sets location to a default value. 
* put dom elements into array, return array. global variable so you don't have to create elements 
everytime -> not heavy on browser. 

reset page -> clears div containers that are hardcoded into html, rebuilds the main page 

*second function -> creates a dom element for each species, appends them to an array
three cards for each species, each pass creates dom element, appends to a local array, then retruns array 
to be stored in a global variable 

*main populates landing page, attaches dom elements to landing page 

*get strain -> take in strain id number, builds an array of urls to call to the api, three api calls 
for 3 species
asynchronously iterates through that array and does and api call for each, pauses until they all return, 
return an array of promises. 

*raceClick 

*buildGoodDogArray creates an array of dog breeds (bridge between two APIS)
creates an array of all of dogs with most attributes in common with strains of weed and sets that to global variable <breedArray>

*createNewDog fetches an array of dogs and randomly selected breeds

selectRandDOg takes in an array, randomly selects a dog from array of adoptable dogs from the breed that is 
associated with the selected strain. 

once user selects a dog, pass that dogs info to buildDogDom which builds info card about new dog and appends 
to main body of the site  -->

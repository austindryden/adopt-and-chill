## Project Description  
Adopt and Chill solves the serious problem of overcrowded animal shelters in a silly way. The user enters a zip code, clicks on an image representing their preferred marijuana species (Indica, Sativa, or Hybrid), and receives two recommendations - a marijuana strain and an available shelter dog with similar characteristics.
